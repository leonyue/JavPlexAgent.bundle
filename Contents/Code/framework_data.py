    The Data API provides methods for storing and retrieving arbitrary data. Plug-ins are generally not allowed to
    access the userâ€™s file system directly, but can use these methods to load and save files in a single directory
    assigned by the framework.

    The data storage locations are unique for each plug-in, preventing one plug-in from modifying data stored by
    another.

    Note: The actual location of data files stored by these methods may vary between platforms.
